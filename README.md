# What does this do?
This application is just a web view for writing and viewing Screenplays written in fountain markup. You can also print it or Print it to PDF. 

## Dependency

This application requires fountain.min.js from [Matt Daly's GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattdaly/Fountain.js). I am using cdn to link

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mattdaly/Fountain.js@master/fountain.min.js"></script>
```

If you want to download and modify you can download from the Matt's repository.
